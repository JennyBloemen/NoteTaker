<h1>Note Taker</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
This class assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was provided and it was my job your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
